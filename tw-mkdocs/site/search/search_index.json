I'm happy to have you here, so get comfortable and start reading... Description Let me introduce myself with a very serious description: I am a physicist with a solid background in theory and mathematics, particularly in the fields of Statistics, Stochastic Processes, and Nonlinear Dynamics. I did a French-Italian master's program in Physics of Complex Systems , where I got interested in Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. I also have seven years of experience as a freelance translator for the pharmaceutical industry documentation, and three years of experience with the communication of science. I am passionate about languages; I speak English, Spanish, Italian, and French, and my hobby is writing short stories in the languages I master. Interests I am interested mainly in the following things, in order: Science Culture Communication Documentation Organization I like to organize my time while working as follows: Time Activity Morning Meetings and Standups Afternoon Research and Writing Evening Study and Relax I wrote this piece of code in my free time, to thank you for the course! docOps = \"Cool course!\" print docOps You can know more about me at my LinkedIn Profile .","title":"About"},{"location":"#presentation","text":"Welcome to my profile!
