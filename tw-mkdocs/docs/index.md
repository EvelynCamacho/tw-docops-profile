# Presentation
**Welcome to my profile!** 

I'm happy to have you here, so get comfortable and start reading...

## Description

*Let me introduce myself with a very serious description:*

I am a physicist with a solid background in theory and mathematics, particularly in the fields of Statistics, Stochastic Processes, and Nonlinear Dynamics. 

I did a French-Italian master's program in **Physics of Complex Systems**, where I got interested in Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science. I also have seven years of experience as a freelance translator for the pharmaceutical industry documentation, and three years of experience with the communication of science. 

I am passionate about languages; I speak English, Spanish, Italian, and French, and my hobby is writing short stories in the languages I master. 

## Interests

I am interested mainly in the following things, in order:

1. Science
2. Culture
3. Communication
4. Documentation

## Organization

I like to organize my time while working as follows:

| Time          |  Activity                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------:|
| Morning       |  Meetings and Standups       |
| Afternoon     |  Research and Writing        |
| Evening       |     Study and Relax          |

I wrote this piece of code in my free time, to thank you for the course!

```python
docOps = "Cool course!"
print docOps
```
